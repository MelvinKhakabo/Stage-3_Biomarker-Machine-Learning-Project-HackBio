Objective
In this project, my main objective was to identify potential cancer biomarkers from a given dataset using differential expression and machine learning models. This project required creative thinking and collaboration, leveraging the strengths of both fields.

General Tasks: 
Picked Breast cancer subtype and downloaded datasets from TCGA.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data 
Handled missing values, normalized gene expression data.
Reduced the data to a maximum of 20 samples for the primary and 20 for the recurring tumor types

Biomarkers:
Conducted differential expression analysis
Conducted functional enrichment analysis

Machine Learning
Prepared the data for ML
Performed feature selection
Conducted kNN or random forest classification

Components of the repo:
Data: Breast Cancer(BRCA) data
Essays: final reports for the ML and Biomarker tasks
Stage 3_ML: ML code using KNN and Random Forest
Stage 3_Biomarker: Output from Biomarker defferential axpression and functional enrichment
